    <h2>2. Third-Party Data Collection (YouTube & Analytics)</h2>
    <p>We integrate specific third-party services which may collect data directly from you.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Embedded YouTube Videos:</strong> The App embeds educational videos hosted on YouTube. When you play these videos, YouTube (Google) may collect information about your view activity, device, and IP address. This data collection is governed by <strong>Google's Privacy Policy and YouTube's Terms of Service</strong>, not this policy. We do not control or receive this data directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics and Advertising:</strong> We use third-party services [e.g., Google Firebase Analytics, AdMob, etc.] to understand how users use the App and to monetize the App via advertisements. These services may collect usage data and unique identifiers to provide aggregated reports to us and to serve personalized advertisements to you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Special Disclosure for AI Assistant and Chat Interface</h2>
    <p>Your privacy related to the AI and chat features is highly important:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Improvement:</strong> We may use the <strong>non-personally identifiable content</strong> of your AI queries to train and improve the AI model. Before use, we take steps to disconnect your conversation history from your User ID and remove sensitive personal information. <strong>Do not submit confidential or highly personal data to the AI assistant.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Chat Interface:</strong> Messages sent in the user chat interface are stored temporarily on our servers to enable communication. We do not monitor or use private conversations for targeted advertising. Users should exercise caution when sharing any personal data in public chat channels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We <strong>do not sell</strong> your Personal Information. We may share your data in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We use third parties (e.g., cloud hosting, analytics providers, ad networks) to perform services on our behalf. These parties are restricted from using your data for any purpose other than providing services to us.</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> If required by law, subpoena, or legal process, or to protect our rights, your safety, or the safety of others.</li>
        <li><strong>With User Consent:</strong> We may share your data with other third parties when we have your explicit consent to do so (e.g., connecting a third-party study tool).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for a <strong>general audience</strong> for educational purposes. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you are under 13, <strong>do not use or provide any information</strong> on this App or through any of its features (including the chat interface).</li>
        <li>If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, please contact us immediately at the email below, and we will delete the information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Data Rights (GDPR / CCPA)</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request copies of the Personal Information we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion (Right to be forgotten):</strong> Request that we erase the Personal Information we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Ask us to correct any incomplete or inaccurate information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures (such as encryption) designed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. We retain your progress data and account information for as long as your account is active or as necessary to provide you with the services.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
